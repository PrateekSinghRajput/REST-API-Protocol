# REST-API-Protocol 🌐⚙️

Welcome to the **REST-API-Protocol** repository! This project demonstrates how to implement and use REST API protocols effectively, especially for IoT sensor data communication. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo will help you understand REST principles and practical usage. 🚀

---

## 📖 What is this project about?

This project showcases how to build and interact with REST APIs using C++ and C, focusing on:

- Sending sensor data (like DHT22) to cloud platforms (e.g., ThingSpeak) using REST.
- Handling bulk data transmission over REST.
- Understanding HTTP headers and partial content handling.
- Learning the basics of REST API protocols in a practical context.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Simple and clear examples of REST API client implementations.
- ✅ Support for sensor data integration with cloud services.
- ✅ Demonstration of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- ✅ Efficient handling of data using HTTP headers like `Content-Length` and `Content-Range`.
- ✅ Written in C++ and C for performance and portability.

## 📚 What is REST API Protocol?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods to interact with resources identified by URLs.

- **Stateless:** Each request contains all necessary information.
- **Uniform Interface:** Resources are accessed via URIs.
- **HTTP Methods:** GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
- **Flexible Data Formats:** JSON, XML, etc.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns for scalability.

REST APIs are widely used for web services and IoT communication due to their simplicity and scalability. 🌍

## 📏 Understanding HTTP Header Size & Comparison with MQTT

- **HTTP Header Size:** Headers carry metadata like content type, authorization, and caching info. They can be large and impact bandwidth and latency, especially in constrained networks. Headers include fields like `Content-Length`, `Accept-Ranges`, and `Content-Range` for efficient data transfer.

- **MQTT Protocol:** A lightweight binary protocol designed for IoT, with minimal fixed header size (2 bytes minimum). It is optimized for low bandwidth and power-constrained devices, unlike REST HTTP headers which are more verbose.

| Aspect               | REST API Headers                          | MQTT Protocol                       |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Header Size          | Can be large (hundreds to thousands bytes) | Very small (2 bytes minimum)       |
| Overhead             | Higher, text-based headers                | Minimal, binary headers            |
| Use Case             | Web services, rich metadata               | IoT messaging, telemetry           |
| Performance          | Higher latency due to header size         | Low latency, efficient             |
